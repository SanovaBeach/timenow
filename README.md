# TimeNow

TimeNow is a challenge I finish from [codewell.cc](https://www.codewell.cc/) website.

I made it using HTML, React, SCSS. This website has a lot of challenge and it's my first time implementing it.
I learned a lot from building this, mainly the header part where I have to split the color. If I found a better way to do this I will implement it here.
I also learned how to toggle the button.
